# simpleLottery
This iis the code for my simple lottery site (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/simple-lottery).

With this site you can add every person you want to take part on any drawn, you can do this adding person by person or just add a bunch of names separated by ';'.

Then just click on the button to execute the raffle.
